I have included a folder called "Planet" which was taken from my IDE, this contains my source code.
I have also included a file called FileFormatter.jar which can be invoked from the command prompt via "java -jar 'FILE LOCATION'".

As per your suggestion I created defensive, maintainable and object oriented code. Please enjoy!
